# pgpg
Implementation of EasyGnuPG with Python and GPGME.

Dependencies: `python3-gpg`.
This can be installed via the package manager bundled with the OS.
In the case of Ubuntu, run `sudo apt install python3-gpg` to install
the `gpg` library for Python. 

Alternatively, building GPGME from source is also an option and 
automatically makes the Python bindings available for use. More 
information about obtaining and building GnuPG can be found 
[here](https://gnupg.org/index.html).
