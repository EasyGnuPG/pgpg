# pgpg

Implementation of EasyGnuPG with Python and GPGME.

## Developer Installation

You should use instructions given at [pgpg-ds](https://github.com/EasyGnuPG/pgpg-ds) for installing pgpg inside a docker container. `pgpg` is in developement phase and should not be tested outside the container. 

The commands which can be tried as of now are
```
pgpg --help
pgpg key --help
pgpg contact --help
```

You should get `NotImplementedError` for others. The above commands without
`--help` option will also produce help only as I haven't pointed them to
anything 

## User Installation

__pgpg__ is in developement stage and not ready for user installation yet
