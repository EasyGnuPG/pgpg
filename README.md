# pgpg
Implementation of EasyGnuPG with Python and GPGME.

Dependencies: `python3-gpg`.
This can be installed via the package manager bundled with the OS.
In the case of Ubuntu, run `sudo apt install python3-gpg` to install
the `gpg` library for Python, after which main.py can be used for testing
if everything imports and works correctly.
